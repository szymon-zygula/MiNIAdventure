-- What other symmetric (two only-one-moves factions) and asymmetric vs crowd
-- scenarios make sense (e.g., are good for a tutorial or for standalone
-- extreme fun or are impossible as part of a crawl)?
-- sparse melee at night: no, shade ambush in brawl is enough
-- dense melee: no, keeping big party together is a chore and big enemy
--   party is less fun than huge enemy party
-- crowd melee in daylight: no, possible in crawl and at night is more fun
-- sparse ranged at night: no, less fun than dense and if no reaction fire,
--   just a camp fest or firing blindly
-- dense ranged in daylight: no, less fun than at night with flares
-- crowd ranged: no, fish in a barrel, less predictable and more fun inside
--   crawl, even without reaction fire
